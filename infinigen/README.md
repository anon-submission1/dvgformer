# Blender Scenes from Infinigen

For synthetic natural scenes, you can either generate your own version from the official git repo [princeton-vl/infinigen](https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen) or directly download from this [link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/dfb1b9d32643ecdc/EgQWiB64W6dCsuOko_UoNQoB9Zj4cb-SSlqLFdVZITJT7Q?e=MBvCGx). Note that our version has very basic graphic settings and you might need to generate your own version if you need higher graphics. 

After downloading the evaluation environments, your folder should look like this
